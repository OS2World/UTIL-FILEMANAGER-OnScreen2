On Screen/2 Source Code Readme
2006/Nov/11
----------------------------------------------------

John Allen has made the source code of OnScreen/2 public under the GNU GPL license.


- Note that the regexp code (regular expression library) has been removed because of re-distribution rights, and currently the source code does not compile. But possible the GNU regexp library can serve as a replacement. 
- It might be best if someone has Borland C++ for OS/2 to try continue with this project.
- Compiling it with G++ would require an important amount of work but will remove the dependacies of the propietary development tool. 


Thanks to the original author, John Allen. (john.allen@dublinux.net) for making it open source.
