OnScreen/2 User's Guide             Page 1-3
 1.    Getting Started

  1.1. Introduction
  Welcome to OnScreen/2, a  sophisticated fullscreen text and binary
  file viewer for the OS/2, and Win32 operating systems  running  on
  IBM compatible PCs based on the 386 or higher CPUs.

  OnScreen/2  displays  files  in  a  text  window  or  fullscreen session and
  provides scrolling,  positioning  and  filtering  commands.   The motivation
  behind OnScreen/2 was to provide an identical (or as near  as  possible  to)
  text mode file viewer for OS/2, and Win32.

  OnScreen/2  provides  a powerful file browser for selecting files which also
  provides basic file management functionality.

  OnScreen/2 supports redirected input (i.e.  piping).

  1.2. Installation
  OnScreen/2 installation could not be simpler, just change into the directory
  where you unzipped OnScreen/2 to and run install.

  If you executed the command unzip os2_50or.zip  in A:\ then you would have a
  directory named OnScreen/2 in A:\.  Simply change to A:\ and type install.

  If you are using PKUNZIP you will have to use the -d  option  otherwise  you
  will not have the required directory structure for the installation program.

  When installing the OS/2 or  Win32  version  you can install either the .DLL
  implementation or the non .DLL  implementation.   If  you  do  not  envisage
  installing  any  of  the  other John Allen utilities (availability early 95)
  then installing the non .DLL version is most likely what you should do.

  The  installation  program  allows you to specify which directory to use for
  the OnScreen/2 base files and the .DLL files.  It also allows you to specify
  whether you want the .DLL version or not.

  1.3. Compatibility
  OnScreen/2  2.50  has  been  tested  for  compatibility  with  the following
  operating systems.

  OS/2: Versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and 3.0/4.0 Warp.

  Windows NT: Version 3.5x, and 4.0 only.

  Windows 95

2.    Using OnScreen/2

  2.1. Starting OnScreen/2
     2.1.1.    Command line syntax
     You may start OnScreen/2 with  or without parameters.  The general syntax
     is as follows:-

     os [switches] [filespec...]

     Switches comprise one or more / characters followed by option letters  or
     numbers. (eg. /help)

     The following switches are available in this release.
     /help                   displays the list of switches
     /ignorestdin            causes OnScreen/2 to ignore redirected stdin
     /raw style              disables filter for specified style
     /search regexp|plain    set searches to regular expression or plain text
     /textwithlayout on|off  turn textwithlayout on or off
     /highbit on|off         turn highbit filter on or off

     A hyphen (-) may be  used  in  place  of  the /. The environment variable
     SWITCHCHAR can be set to the list of characters that will be accepted  as
     switch characters. (eg. SET SWITCHCHAR=/-$)

     Filespec may  be  one  or  more  filenames  which  may contain wildcards.
     OnScreen/2 uses a regular expression pattern matcher  for  the  wildcards
     and  therefore does not conform to the standard OS/2, Win32 command shell
     wildcards.

     OnScreen/2 wildcards are as follows:-

     *      Match zero or more occurrences of any character.
     .      Match the period/fullstop character.
     ?      Match a single occurence of any character.
     [az]   Match a single occurence of specified characters.
     [a-z]  Match a single occurence of specified range of characters.

     For  example  the  wildcard  file  specification xxx.[qa]*.xyz will match
     files beginning with xxx.  followed  by  a  q  or  an  a and zero of more
     occurrences of any character followed by .xyz.

     If OnScreen/2 is started without any command line parameters  or  with  a
     single  parameter  which  is the name of a directory it will bring up the
     file browser.

     2.1.2.    Redirection/piping
     OnScreen/2 is capable of acting as  a command line filter.  An example of
     this is:-

     [C:\]dir c:\ /s | os

     There  are  some  restrictions in the current release.  With this release
     OnScreen/2 has to read the entire output before it will display anything.
     This means that until  the  command  which  is  generating the output has
     completed you will not be able to view the output with OnScreen/2.   This
     restriction will be lifted in a future release.






------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OnScreen/2 User's Guide             Page 2-6

  2.2. Exiting OnScreen/2
  There are three different ways to exit from OnScreen/2.

   The Alt+Q command clears the screen and then returns to the prompt.  The  Q
   and X commands also perform the same function.  The Alt+Q function works in
   both  the file viewer and the file browser.  The Q and X commands only work
   in the file viewer.

   The Alt+A command returns  to  the  prompt  clearing  the  last line on the
   screen but otherwise leaving the display exactly as it was.  The Ctrl+X and
   ESC commands also perform the same function  but  only  work  in  the  file
   viewer and the ESC command only quits if there are no files are loaded.

   The Alt+X key combination restores the screen to the display you had before
   OnScreen/2  was  run  and then returns to the prompt.  It works in both the
   file viewer and the file browser.













































------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OnScreen/2 User's Guide             Page 2-7
  2.3.  File Viewer
     2.3.1.    Commands
     You control the OnScreen/2 File  Viewer  by pressing keys or combinations
     of keys which correspond to the OnScreen/2 File  Viewer  commands.   Some
     commands  have  more  than one key combination associated with them, e.g.
     Next File = Alt+N or Ctrl+PgDn.

     The key combinations associated with specific commands are pre-programmed
     into the OnScreen/2 File Viewer and cannot be changed at this time.  This
     restriction will be lifted in a future release.

     2.3.2.    Text with layout information
     OnScreen/2 can display  files  containing  text  with layout information.
     Files with layout information  contain  special  characters  that  direct
     OnScreen/2  to display subsequent characters in a different colour.  This
     User's Guide contains these special  characters.  If you are viewing this
     guide using OnScreen/2 you can press L now to  toggle  text  with  layout
     information off so you can see these characters.

     Two methods of controlling the colour of the text are supported.
     UNIX(tm) nroff style and Wordstar(tm) style.

     nroff uses the following format:-

      _<BKSPACE><CHARACTER>            Display character in underlined colour.
      <CHARACTER><BKSPACE><CHARACTER>  Display character in bold colour.

     Wordstar(tm) uses the following format:-

      ^B  text ^B                      Display text in bold colour.
      ^S  text ^S                      Display text in underlined colour.
     ^B^S  text ^S^B                   Display text in bold and underlined
                                       colour.

     The  text  with  layout  option can be toggled with the L command, it can
     also be set on a per  file-type  basis  by creating a style with the text
     with layout option either ON or OFF in the os.set settings file

     2.3.3.    Tab Expansion
     When Tab expansion is enabled OnScreen/2 will display the correct  number
     of  spaces for each Tab character it encounters.  The default Tab size is
     3, but this can be changed with  the Tab and Shift+Tab commands.  The Tab
     size can also be set on a per file-type basis by creating a style with  a
     specific Tab size in the os.set settings file.

     2.3.4.    Hex Mode
     Hex  mode  displays  the  file  in a format similar to the debug command.
     When switching between text mode  and  hex  mode an attempt to retain the
     same positioning is made, but this is not always perfect.  Hex  mode  can
     be  toggled  with  the  H  command, it can also be set on a per file-type
     basis by creating a style with  hex  mode  either ON or OFF in the os.set
     settings file.










------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OnScreen/2 User's Guide             Page 2-8
     2.3.5.    Hi-bit filter
     The high-bit filter strips the high-bit from all characters  above  ASCII
     127.   It  also  handles  the 0x8D character as a carriage-return thereby
     allowing easy viewing of Wordstar(tm)  files.  The high-bit filter can be
     toggled with the .  command.  It can also be set on a per file-type basis
     by creating a style with the high-bit filter either  ON  or  OFF  in  the
     os.set settings file.

     2.3.6.    Bookmarks
     You  can  set  a  bookmark  with  the Alt+0..9 commands.  You can go to a
     previously set bookmark  with  the  Alt+G  command  followed by the digit
     representing the bookmark you wish to jump to.

     If you drop a bookmark that you had already set elsewhere then it will be
     reset to the new location.  If you wish to clear a bookmark simply go  to
     it and then set it again, this will clear it.

     2.3.7.    Memory usage
     OnScreen/2  normally  only  keeps one file loaded at a time (ie.  the one
     you're looking  at),  this  helps  reduce  memory  usage.   The K command
     toggles between keeping all the files you have looked at loaded and  just
     loading the one you are currently viewing.

     Obviously  keeping  all files loaded speeds up switching between multiple
     loaded files but it also uses  lots  more memory.  The default is to only
     keep the currently viewed file loaded.

     2.3.8.    Searching
     OnScreen/2  provides  for  searches  which  can  be  case-sensitive   and
     case-insensitive  and may be either forwards or backwards as you require.
     OnScreen/2  also  provides  for  regular  expression  searches.   Regular
     expressions are a powerful way of expressing a pattern that a search will
     match.

     With regular expressions you can specify searches such as the following:-

     d[ie]*lay

     This will find text where it begins with a d followed by an i or an e and
     zero or more occurrences  of  any  character  followed by lay.  This will
     find words such as delay and display.

     Unlike  typical  UNIX based applications OnScreen/2's regular expressions
     are capable of being case-sensitive or case-insensitive.

     For a case-sensitive search use the S,  Alt+S  or  /  commands,  and  for
     case-insensitive  searches use the F, Alt+F or \ commands.  The Alt+F and
     Alt+S commands search backwards.

     OnScreen/2 starts searches either from  the line the current selection is
     on, or from the top of the file if there is no selection active.  You can
     clear the current selection with the C command.

     The A and Ctrl+L commands repeat the previous search.  All the parameters
     of the previous search are preserved with the exception of the setting of
     the regular expression toggle, which can be toggled on  and  off  between
     repeat searches.

     OnScreen/2  will  scroll the display up, down, left or right as necessary
     to bring the matching text  into  view.   Only  the matching text will be
     highlighted not the entire line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OnScreen/2 User's Guide             Page 2-9
     2.3.9.      Invoking a shell
     You can invoke a shell by using the Alt+O command.  This will take you to
     the current default shell for the operating system for  which  OnScreen/2
     has  been  compiled.   

     Use the EXIT command to return to OnScreen/2.

     2.3.10.   Video mode support
     OnScreen/2 supports whatever text mode you happend to be in.  It does not
     have any built in facility to change text mode.  You can change  it  with
     the  mode  command  or  a  utility which may have been supplied with your
     video card.

     Windows NT allows  you  to  change  the  number  of  rows  and columns of
     windowed sessions.  It is not recommended that you change these  settings
     while  you  are  running OnScreen/2.  It is also not recommended that you
     switch to  fullscreen  if  you  are  using  settings  that  would  not be
     supported there.

     OnScreen/2 cannot operate in less than 80 column mode.

     2.3.11.     Invoking an editor
     The Alt+E command invokes an editor on the current file.  The editor must
     be set in the os.set file.  A default editor can be assigned by  defining
     a  style from which all others inherit.  SubStyles can prevent editing by
     setting the editor to blank.

     eg. Editor =>

     2.3.12.     Status Lines
     The top and bottom lines of  the  display are status lines.  The top line
     provides status information relating to the file currently being viewed.

     The bottom status line displays the name  of  the  program,  the  release
     version  and  the operating system it was compiled for.  It also displays
     the copyright message and  any  error  messages  as  well as serving as a
     location for menu type selection and line editing.  On the far  right  it
     shows  the  current  time in 12 hour format.  The environment variable TZ
     must be set for the time to be displayed correctly.  (eg.  SET TZ=GMT)

     There are 3 distinct formats for the top status line.  They can be cycled
     through with the Alt+Z command.

Format 1.

     The file browser  provides  for  quick  file  and  directory selection by
     allowing you to type in a prefix for the file you are trying to select.

     For example if you are trying to select the file  custinv.cpp  you  could
     type cus and this will move the file selection bar to the first file with
     the prefix cus.

     The  Tab and Backspace keys move you forwards and backwards respectively.
     If you hold down the shift key  then  you are in directory select mode as
     opposed to file select mode.

OnScreen/2 User's Guide             Page 2-14
3.    Configuration
OnScreen/2's configuration can be controlled from the  keyboard  or  from  the
os.set  file.   The  preferred method is to use the os.set file as this is the
way all OnScreen/2 settings will be stored in the future.

If you are viewing  a  file  for  which  a  style  applies and make changes to
OnScreen/2 settings using the command keys, you are only affecting that style.
The bottom status line will indicate that a change has been made to a style as
against a global change.

  3.1. Styles
  The  os.set  file  allows  for  the specification of one or more user defined
  styles which can be associated with  specific file extensions.  Comments in a
  set file begin with a ; and end at eol.

  Style name (extensions list) [inherited styles]
  {
  BackGndColor        => Green
  }

  eg.
  Style C++ (.cpp .cxx .hxx .hpp) Default, C
  {
  Reserved       => private
                 => catch
  SingleLineComment   => //
  }

  This declares a style called C++ which is associated  with  files  with  the
  extensions .cpp .cxx .hxx .hpp and inherits from the styles Default and C. A
  style does not have to inherit from other styles.

  The  extensions  list can also be a single *, which indicates that this is a
  default style which will apply to  all  files which have either no extension
  or an extension for which a specific style has not  been  defined.   If  you
  specify this default style it should appear as the first style in the os.set
  file.

  See the supplied os.set file for complete examples.
