; This is an example OnScreen/2 settings file.
;
; You can set a variety of OnScreen/2 items in this file.
; * Key bindings (not yet)
; * Colours for status lines
; * Colours for file manager (not yet)
; * Colours for buffer list (not yet)
; * Other global OnScreen/2 settings
; * Styles, including syntax highlighting
;
; In this file you can specify the styles which OnScreen/2 will apply
; to files with specific extensions.
;
; Files with either no extension or with an extension which is not
; listed here will use the OnScreen/2 defaults.
;
; (C) 1995 Warp Factor 7, All rights reserved.
;
; Comments start with a ; and end at EOL. The ; must be the first
; non whitespace character on the line
;
; The syntax for the style heading is as follows
; Keyword StyleName File-Ext-List Inherited-Styles
; Style   Pascal    (.pas) 		 Base Default...
;
; These settings if present will override the settings made with the OnScreen
; command keys.
;
; All styles inherit from the settings made with the OnScreen/2 command keys,
; this allows a style to just override the elements which is requires
; changes to.
